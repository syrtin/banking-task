## !Developer's comments:

To perform the task as close as possible to given stack, I had to avoid of using my favourite technologies:
- Java17
- Lombok
- Spring Boot 3
- Spring Validation API
- Spring Data JDBC
- Assertj

To my mind, app would be much better if they were used.

But the developer's job is to stick to the initial technical requirements.
